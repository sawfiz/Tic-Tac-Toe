# Library
[Project: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) from the [Javascript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript), [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## To-do
  - 

## Key new concepts used
- Assets

  
- HTML


- Styling

  
- Javascript
  - Use `let` to declare an array if I want to reassign it's value, instead of `const`
  - Use `console.log(JSON.parse( JSON.stringify( board ) ))` to show array content, otherwise the console re-evaluates it's content at the time of clicking on the triangle
  - `removeEventListener()`, but I did not use it.  It was more effective to use `squareEl.style.pointerEvents = 'none';`
